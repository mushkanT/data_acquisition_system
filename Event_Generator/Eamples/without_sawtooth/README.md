# Overview:
   This gives information about the rise and fall of events. These events have different amptitudes depending on the range we    have entered. We use the pyplot library to plot the events in a continuous fashion. Also in this plot we have added padding of the randomm number of zeros and randomised the file to generate real time like events
    
#  How to run:

open the terminal and go to the directory

    $ cd generator/Event_Generator/Eamples
    
Now run the script 

    $python3 with_sawtooth.py
