# Overview:
We have already generated Gaussian curve based on different input parameters provided like mean and standard deviation.Now a reverse process is applied to recalculate the Gaussian graph given the event file of the event. We also notice that it still retransforms to a gaussian distribution as in the initial plot.We have used the function plotrehisto to plot using the file "my_file.txt".
    
#  How to run:

open the terminal and go to the directory

    $ cd generator/Event_Generator/Eamples
    
Now run the script 

    $python3 without_sawtooth.py
#  Output:
