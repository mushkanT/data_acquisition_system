# Overview:
Simply, an oscilloscope is a sophisticated diagnostic instrument that draws a graph of an electrical signal. This graph can tell you many things about a signal, such as:

The time and voltage values of a signal.
The frequency of an oscillating signal.
The "moving parts" of a circuit represented by the signal.
The frequency with which a particular portion of the signal occurs relative to other portions.
Whether or not a malfunctioning component is distorting the signal.
How much of a signal is direct current (DC) or alternating current (AC).
How much of the signal is noise and whether the noise is changing with time.
 
# Coclusion:

From the above exersise we come to a conclude that usage of a dynamic axis scalling librarby is to be created with basic time and amplitude axis. As a part of our implementation w.r.t. code
